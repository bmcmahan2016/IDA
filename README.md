# README
This is a README for Interventional Diffusion Assist (IDA).
IDA is a type of interventional assist (IA).
Broadly, IA is a framework for shared autonomy that allows for dynamic control sharing between an assistive artificial intelligence (AI) agent or copilot and a human.

## High Level Work Flow
This section outlines the steps required to train a copilot and derive an intervention function for using IDA. There are three main components or modules for IDA: a human controller, an assisitive AI controller (copilot), and an intervention function (which determines how control is shared between the human and copilot).
